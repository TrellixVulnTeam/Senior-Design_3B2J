	The project will be able to automate student pickup from school. Parents or guardians need to
have a tag that will be read by RFID reader. From the RFID reader the school staffs shall be able to get
the name and other information of the students. This shall expedite the process of student pickup as
now parents are using a piece of paper to pick up their kids. Initial versions of the system will use a
wire tether for data transfer between the RFID and processing unit. The majority of processing will be
accomplished by RFID and processor.
