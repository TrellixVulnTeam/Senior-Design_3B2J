\quad \quad For parents that pick up their children from school, it is often a long and tedious process. Pulling into the designated lane amongst several other parents and their vehicles, having a staff member verify who they are, whom you are picking up and then calling out your child's name over the radio to finally have them get ready to leave the building with all their belongings.  To address this concern, we are building an automated system that will verify who has arrived, what student needs to be made ready for dismissal and to send that information over to a centralized location for staff to streamline dismissal.
