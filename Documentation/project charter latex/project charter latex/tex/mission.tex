\quad \quad The primary mission of this project is to replace traditional method of picking children from school. The system will use Rfid scanner to scan the incoming vehicle of parents of the children in school. The application that run in windows will process the information collected by scanner. The Rfid scanner scan the vehicle with rfid sticker and display the information of the parents and children in the gui. The interactive gui will show the list of information of children whose parents have arrived. The list will be updated as new vehicle is detected by the scanner. The application will show the names of students who have left and who have not left from school on that particular day. The application will also save the information in database for future reference.
