\quad \quad We have \$800 provided by the Computer Science department of UTA for the project. At the moment, we do not have any financial donors for the project. We are going to use personal computer and the Rfid scanner for the lab, so we will not have much expenditure. We will spend approximately \$100 to buy the hardware to structure the system.
