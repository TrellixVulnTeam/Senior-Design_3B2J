\quad \quad The development and prototyping of RDF student pick-up will take place 
in Senior Design Lab. All the hardware design and development will take place in the 
lab during Senior Design I. We have received the RFID reader from the school. 
We will also be using common tools such as the drills, screwdrivers, saws, and allen 
wrenches from the Senior Design Lab. We may use a 3D printer as the need arises. 
Tools that are not available from the lab will be brought by our team with Professor's 
approval. Upon completion of the RFID student pick-up, we will be testing it at the 
senior design lab and parking lot of the school.
