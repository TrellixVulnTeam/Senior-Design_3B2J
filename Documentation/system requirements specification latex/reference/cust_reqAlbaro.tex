Additional Administrator Privilege

DESCRIPTION

The application will provide only limited access to the staff. The only thing a staff can do after logging in to the system will be checking out the students based upon the arrival of their parents. The staff should not be able to perform other administrative functions such as adding students, removing students and changing RFID tags.

SOURCE

The source of the requirements are the customers.

CONSTRAINTS

We will have to make separate GUI for staff and for admin. The one for the staff will only display limited buttons while the one for the admin will contain full functionality.


PRIORITY

This requirement has high priority because if a staff performs any changes in the system, it will be difficult to maintain high security.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT

Read multiple form of RFID

DESCRIPTION

There are several types of RFID tags such as windshield stickers and cards. The scanner should be able to read any of them and send signal to the computer with correct information.

SOURCE


The source of the requirements are the senior design team 2.

CONSTRAINTS

The scanner will read a same tag multiple times but the application should filter the repetition and send only one notification for one RFID tag.

PRIORITY

This requirement has high priority parents may have any form of RFID tags and they should be handled carefully by the scanner as well as the application.



\subsection{Quick RFID Detection}
\subsubsection{Description}
