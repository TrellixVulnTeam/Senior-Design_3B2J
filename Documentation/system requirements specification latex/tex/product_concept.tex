\quad \quad This section describes the purpose, use, and intended user audience for the RFID 
Automated Student Pickup (RASP) System. The system detects vehicles with RFID tags and 
can display the information of related individuals to be released, providing a swift 
and secure channel for dismissing students.

\subsection{Purpose and Use}

\quad \quad RASP contains both hardware and software. The hardware used will detect RFID tags and 
transmit the data to a local database. This database will have both an active and 
passive mode. While in active mode the data queried will generate a list of students 
to dismiss in a queue. Passive mode will allow system administrators to modify the 
database, view logs of information and view trends in the data collected.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
\quad \quad The Intended Audience is Elementary Schools. These schools currently have 
systems in place which require active participation by multiple educators. This system 
hopes to alleviate some of the required labor of dismissing students, while also 
providing a base level of security and increasing the flow of students leaving. This 
product is designed for comercial use, but intended to be standalone. The system is 
customizable for the site of deployment.
