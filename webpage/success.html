<p> This project will be considered successful if the outcome is able to replicate the core functionalities of the current staff employee's dismissal duties by the RFID reader. 
Namely, the ability to relay arriving parents notice to the correct staff members who have authorization to dismiss that parent's child.The goal will require the construction of a RFID reader, housing, and mount connected to the system which will not succumb to outside elements. A successful example would be that the parents drive by with a RFID Tag placed on the windshield of their vehicles, the RFID reader, reads the tag and sends that notice to the system database to query and recover all associated information for the staff member to confidently release/dismiss the child that belongs to that parent all before the parent arrives to the pickup area. </p>
