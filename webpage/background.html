    <h1 align="center" style="color:blue;">Background</h1>
<p> The idea for this project was addressed by the professor to the group. 
One of the professors on campus had to go pick up her kid from school. There the 
parents take a paper with the child's name so that the employees at school knew who 
the parent want to pick up. This method is slow as parents had to wait for a while 
before they saw their children, it is not convenient for the school employees as they 
had to adjust for all sort of weather and it is not safe for the child as people with 
evil intentions can have access to kids name.
The team decided to take on this project because we realized that the concern is 
serious and if we can finish the project and bring it in-front of schools they will be 
able to use it. This will not only benefit us as students rather the parents, kids, 
employees at school as well as school. This project has real-world benefit and can be 
used in multiple fields. For example, this project can be used at a fast food place as 
well as customers can order using their phone where they can enter their license plate 
number and when they come inside the field of fast food place, the fast food employee 
can bring their food out right away after the scanner reads their license plate. 
Analyzing the wide range of fields where this project can be used in real world and 
the positive impacts that it can have on people and businesses, we have chosen this 
project. </p>
