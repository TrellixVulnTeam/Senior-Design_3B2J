<p> There are similarly related applications for schools to utilize that would 
help with tracking the students at various times of uncertainty such as when the 
students travels by bus and when they arrive at school.
The related commercially available products are listed below:

	Attendance Model (GPS + RFID), Basic GPS Tracking Systems, GPS + RFID Systems.

	http://northstar.global/rfid-school-bus-tracking-system/ - Northstar's RFID 
	system helps track the movement of children in schools and verifies if students 

	are getting off at the right bus stop. It also helps automate attendance.

	http://rfid.thingmagic.com/rfid-blog/bid/50802/RFID-for-Student-Tracking - 
	he benefits of RFID-enabled student tracking solutions are providing secure access 
to a building and recording attendance. 


	These systems are primarily put in place for when the students arrive or 
when they board transportation provided by the school for parents to have SMS updates 
sent to their phones in real time. Our project will utilized the same technology but 
only focus on the dismissal tracking for students so that the system automates what 
child needs to be made ready for dismissal whenever their parent has arrived and is 
ready to pick up their child. </p>
